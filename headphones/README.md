🎧 Headphones Landing Page

A pixel-perfect, fully responsive web page built from scratch using only HTML and CSS, following a Figma prototype designed by Nicolas Philippot (UI/UX).

This project is part of the ALX Front-End Engineering Curriculum, focusing on mastering real-world concepts like semantic HTML, responsive layouts, accessibility rules, and matching professional UI designs — all with no JavaScript and no external CSS frameworks.

🚀 Project Goals

Rebuild the Figma design exactly as provided — no shortcuts, no libraries, no magic.

This project demonstrates your ability to:

Craft clean, semantic, accessible HTML

Build responsive layouts with pure CSS

Recreate a real UI design with precision

Manage different layout states (desktop → tablet → mobile)

Use Figma like a frontend engineer

Maintain pixel consistency across breakpoints

Respect constraints (no JS, no Bootstrap, no Tailwind — only your skills)

🎨 Final UI Screens

The final page contains these major sections:

Hero section with background image and CTA

Navigation bar

“What we do” services section

Statistics / results block

Contact form

Footer with icons

Each section has a matching mobile layout at ≤ 480px.
